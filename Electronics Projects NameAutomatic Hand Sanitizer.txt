Project Name:

Automatic Hand Sanitizer. Description: Demand for hand sanitizers has surged since the coronavirus broke out and spread around the world. Hand sanitizers are usually applied by squirting the sanitizer liquid when one presses a pump with one’s hand. This causes many people to come into contact with the pump handle, which increases the risk of viral transmission. Some hand sanitizers on the market are automatically pumped. However, because sanitizer containers and pump devices are designed to be compatible only between products produced by the same manufacturer, consumers must also repurchase the container for the liquid if they replace the hand sanitizer. Therefore, this report suggests the design of an automatic hand sanitizer system compatible with various sanitizer containers.

Tools:

 IR sensor,DC motor,hand sanitizer with a built-in pump, battery and wire connector,Arduino,Metal inserts,Metal rod etc. Controller Block Design: As seen in Fig.: 1 the Automatic hand sanitizer device consists of a power supply, sensor, board, motor controller, and motor. The power supply provides voltage and current for the operation of the motor and board, and its power source is a battery. Through a regulator, the board converts 9 V power from the power supply to 5 V and applies it to the sensor . Infrared (IR) sensors beam infrared rays from the light-emitting unit, and it is reflected from the surface of the object and absorbed at a light-receiving unit. The motor controller consists of an H-Bridge motor driver , which can control the motor according to the input value of the sensor. The DC motor provides a major force to the device and is controlled by the motor driver.

Contoller Algorithm:


 int onOffTime; int IRSense; int autoOffTrigger=0; void setup() { pinMode(5, OUTPUT); //Motor pump control pin pinMode(2, OUTPUT); //Sensor sensing Pin Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { int IRSense= analogRead(A0); // Read Sensor Value int onOffTime= analogRead(A1); // Read How much volume to dispense

int time=map(onOffTime,0,1023,0,10);//convert to simple scale Serial.println("IR: "+String(IRSense)); Serial.println("pot: "+String(onOffTime)+ ": "+String(time)); if(IRSense >78) //If sense higher than 78 LED INDICATE { digitalWrite(2,1); } else { digitalWrite(2,0); } //IF IR sense higher than 78 //Motor pump will ON for Sometime mentioned in "time" //Then Turn Off if(IRSense >78 && autoOffTrigger==0) { digitalWrite(5,1); delay(time*1000); // 1000 is 1000 millisecond(s) digitalWrite(5,0); autoOffTrigger=1; Serial.println("Dispensing... "); } else if(IRSense <78) { //AutoOFFTrigger is used to cut off motor pump //Make for each sense, only onetime dispenser will come out autoOffTrigger=0; }

Advantages:



 1.Touch-free: Furthermore, a more sterile environment is created by the improvement of the automatic sanitizer dispenser. By using the pump, we will leave behind a variety of bacterial colonies. Then they will interbreed and lead to a more resistant strain of bacteria which can recontaminate different hands and would not be completely eliminated by the anti-bacterial soap or sanitizer. Wider spectra or higher levels of resistance in the present colonies are due to interaction and/or complementation between the resistance genes. Bacterial transmission will be eliminated once we stop using and touching the pump. 2. Preset increments: These devices will only distribute a set amount per motion activation. A specified amount to be dispensed can be set to a highly efficient quantity in which waste will be minimal. 3. Flexibility: Besides hand sanitizer, dispenser's structure also works for other liquids: soap, lotion, laundry detergent etc. The wide range of possibilities widens the use of the dispenser to various other locations other than the bathroom. Disadvantages: 1.Batteries wear down.:Most automatic dispensers have some sort of LED indicator that will alert maintenance staff that the batteries are low. But, when an automatic dispensers stops working, hand hygiene stops as well. 2.Batteries add cost: Most touchless dispensers are very efficient and continue to work for many, many months. But, batteries do run down and will need to be replaced at a cost of at least a few dollars per dispenser. Over time, and with a lot of dispensers in a facility, this cost can really add up. 3.Batteries are not always available: Maintenance personnel do not typically carry batteries with them. They also don’t typically stock batteries in their inventory. So, unless the staff is prepared when dispenser batteries run out, the soap and hand sanitizer can stop flowing for a long period of time.
